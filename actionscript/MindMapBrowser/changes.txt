The Code was modified to serve the purposes of WikiMindMap Browser.
Major Changes to the original are the following:
	- Clicking on a node results in an link-action, the url is passed by a specific nodetype. On node can be of serveral Types.
	- There are +/- areas to expand/reduce nodes
	- New Node-Types are set as Attributes of the Node-Element of the XML:
		- Web-Link:  Opens another Website (Attribute WEBLINK)
		- Wiki-Link: Opens the Wiki and points to the specific topic (Attribute WIKILINK
		- MindMap-Link: Brings a node to the center (works via a url to the html, where the browser is embedded) (Attribute MMLINK)
	- The browser was optimized to be as small and light as possible. Therefore feautres were reduced to the necessary minimum.
	- There is no guarantee that original .mm Files can still be interpreted
