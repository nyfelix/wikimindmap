ABOUT WIKIMINDMAP
=================

WikiMindMap is a tool to browse easily and efficiently in Wiki content, 
inspired by the mindmap technique. Wiki pages in large public wiki's, such as wikipedia, 
have become rich and complex documents. Thus, it is not allways straight forward to find 
the information you are really looking for. This tool aims to support users to get a good 
structured and easy understandable overview of the topic you are looking for.
